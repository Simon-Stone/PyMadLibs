# PyMadLibs
A Mad Libs game written in Python

## What is this?
This was a coding exercise I did for fun and practice. I chose an object-oriented design and focused on an abstract approach. There are no specific references to any finite set of category names so the little program should be able to handle pretty much any kind of Mad Libs you can come up with. 

## How to use
Just run ``main.py``. The prompts should be fairly self-explanatory.

You can add Mad Libs templates by adding a ``.madlibs`` file to the folder ``Stories``. The format is very simple: Where you would normally find an empty line and a category name in a Mad Libs sheet, you simply insert the category name in curly braces. There is no limited set of categories, the only constraint is that they have to be enclosed by curly braces. Check the included files for examples.
